	<h2>What is Domestic Violence?</h2>
		<br>
	<p>Domestic violence and emotional abuse are behaviors used by one person in a relationship to control the other. Partners may be married or not married; heterosexual, gay, or lesbian; living together, separated or dating.
	</font>
	</p>
	<h3>Examples of abuse include</h3>
	<p>
  name-calling or putdowns
  keeping partner from containing their family or friends
  withholding money
  stopping a partner from getting or keeping a job
  sexual assault
  stalking
  intimidation</p>


	<p>Violence can be criminal and includes physical assault (hitting, pushing, shoving, etc.), sexual abuse (unwanted or forced sexual activity), and stalking. Although emotional, psychological and financial abuse are not criminal behaviors, they are forms of abuse and can lead to criminal violence.</p>
<p>The violence takes many forms and can happen all the time or once in a while. An important step to help yourself or someone you know in preventing or stopping violence is recognizing the warning signs listed on the "Violence Wheel."</font></p>

	<p><strong>ANYONE CAN BE A VICTIM!</strong> Victims can be of any age, sex, race, culture, religion, education,
		employment or marital status. Although both men and women can be abused, most victims are women. Children in homes where
		there is domestic violence are more likely to be abused and/or neglected. Most children in these homes know about the violence.
		Even if a child is not physically harmed, they may have emotional and behavior problems.</p>
	<p>If you are being abused, REMEMBER 
		<br>You are not alone
		<br>It is not your fault
