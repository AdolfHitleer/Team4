		<h2>Sallie's story</h2>
		<br>
		<p>I was once in an emotionally abusive relationship. He changed once we moved in together – before that I thought he was
			a really nice guy, but unfortunately his pattern of behaviour changed. I hope that this stage of manipulation would pass
			and I certainly found out how naive I was. The type that didn’t know the meaning of a little bit of privacy, always looking
			through my things, questioning my activities, questioning me about my past, consistently brought me down about my weight,
			compared me to his ex-wife, called me names and his actions made me feel wrong about everything.He’d even ignore me as
			soon as he walked through the front door, not even a hello, – it was like I didn’t exist except when he wanted something.
			Falling in love doesn’t mean the guy is right for you, because any form of abuse should be taken very seriously. Eventually,
			I withdrew and kept everything to myself and I even started to get depressed, at one time I didn’t know who I was anymore.</P>

		<h2>Alex's story</h2>
		<br>
		<p>My partner has been physically and emotionally abusing me for about twelve months. It’s started with pushing and shoving
			and taking my keys when I wanted to leave. He was very insecure about past relationships and jealous of people he thought
			were a threat. We would have evenings where he’d been drinking and start accusing me of being a ‘whore’ amongst other
			names. It would go on for hours until he would fall asleep. The next day it was always the same, he was sorry and he didn’t
			know why he said it and did the things he did.I believed him at first but after the third time I knew it was a mistake
			and I had to get out. The final straw was the worst behavior, hours of verbal abuse and name calling and then he became
			violent when I tried to call someone. That night it dawned on me things will never change. I had to put myself first and
			do what was right for me. How could I let myself be hurt this way?</p>
		<h2>John's story</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Nothing I ever did was good enough. She always told me I was pathetic, fat and lazy. She told me that I needed to find
			a better job if she was going to stick around. One day I asked her to please stop and she went into a rage and tried to
			hit me, just as her brother walked in. I grabbed her arms to protect myself and when she spotted her brother she started
			sobbing “stop hitting me”. Her brother knew the truth and offered some support, but she told our friends I was abusive
			and most of them wouldn't speak to me. This sort of thing went on almost daily for 5 years but then things seemed to improve
			over a period of a few months. I thought “at last she knows how much I love her”. Then she walked in one day and said
			she was leaving me and had been having an affair with one of her brother's friends. She also took several thousand dollars
			– emptied our joint account – and said “this is my compensation for putting up with you”. I would see her from time to
			time in the small town we lived in and all she would do was to stop, point and laugh out loud, screwing with my mind long
			after she left me.</p>
