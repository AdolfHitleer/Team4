	<h3 style="color: darkorchid">Brief Definition Of Domestic Violence</h3>
	<p style="color: darkmagenta">Domestic violence (also domestic abuse, spousal abuse, intimate partner violence, battering or family violence) is a pattern of behavior which involves violence or other abuse by one person against another in a domestic setting, such as in marriage or cohabitation. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is violence by a spouse or partner in an intimate relationship against the other spouse or partner. Domestic violence can take place in heterosexual and same-sex family relationships, and can involve violence against children in the family or, in some U.S. states, violence against a roommate. It also includes violence committed by children toward either parent and other siblings.</p>
